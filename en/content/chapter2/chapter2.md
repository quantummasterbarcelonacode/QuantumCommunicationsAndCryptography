# Basics Elements of Quantum Information Theory

The previous section summarizes the quantum formalism and presents the main tools that will be needed in what follows. In this section, we introduce some of the most basic concepts in Quantum Information Theory (QIT): the quantum bit and quantum gates (or operations). Once all these concepts have been introduced, we will illustrate through the no-cloning theorem and Bell's theorem how QIT can drastically depart from its classical counterpart.
